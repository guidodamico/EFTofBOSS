RedshiftBiasEFTwithFFT (30/08/2018)

Designed by: L. Senatore, Pierre Zhang
Developed by: Pierre Zhang

Introduction
------------
RedshiftBiasEFTwithFFT is a C++ code that computes the IR-resummed power spectrum of biased tracers in redshift space at the one loop.
The loops are calculated analytically for power-law power spectra produced from an FFTLog decomposition of the linear power spectrum.

Requirements
------------
RedshiftBiasEFTwithFFT is written in C++ with standard ISO C++11. 

Three libraries are required for compilation:
- the GSL library <https://www.gnu.org/software/gsl/>
- the FFTW library <http://www.fftw.org/>
- the Eigen library <http://eigen.tuxfamily.org/> 
The code should be provided with the Eigen headers in the source: no installation should be required for the Eigen library.

The loop calculation involves a discrete Fourier transformation routine from the FFTW library
and the use of the Eigen library for efficient matrix / vector multiplication.

The IR-resummation makes use of the FFTLog algorithm first written in Fortran by A. Hamilton: 
<http://casa.colorado.edu/~ajsh/FFTLog/>, then translated in C by J. Carlson within the
Copter library: <http://mwhite.berkeley.edu/Copter/>, which is released under the GNU General 
Public License, see <https://www.gnu.org/licenses/gpl-3.0.en.html>. The files 'fftlog.h' and 
'fftlog.cpp' are from the Copter library. 


Compiling and running
---------------------
Adjust or include paths to the GSL and FFTW libraries in Makefile, and run 'make'.

To run RedshiftBiasEFTwithFFT type:
./RedshiftBiasEFT path/to/inifile

An example inifile can be found in ./input/RedshiftBiasEFT.ini


Outputs
-------
RedshiftBiasEFTwithFFT generates six files :
'PowerSpectraLinear_lX.dat' and 'PowerSpectra1loop_lX.dat' with X = 0,2,4 being the multipoles.

First line in the output files (with an '#' at the beginning) is the legend for the columns:
# k[h/Mpc]    bi    ... 
... which means that the first column is the k's for which the power spectra in the other column 
are evaluated and 'bi' is the bias coefficients multiplying the power spectra in the corresponding
column.

A great amount of work went into the development of the theory and the first 
computations. Therefore, we would be very grateful if the following set of 
papers were to be cited if using this code.
